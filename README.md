# Networking-Applications
This was my first experience using the sockets library and working with UDP and TCP connections for communication and server configuration.
In this project, I learned how to encode and decode messages within both UDP and TCP connections, for both the sender and the listener.
I also developed a stronger understanding of the OSI model and its specific layers and steps.
